<body><h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
  <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    Walla Walla,WA,Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, Co, Why, AZ and Truth or
    Consequences, NM.

  <p>I saw some Burma Shave style sigins on the side of the road today: "Passing cars,
   When you can't see, May getyou, A glimpse, Of eternity."I definitely won't be passing any cars.

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed
    and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with
    me : cell phone, iPod,digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.As Lao
    Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
